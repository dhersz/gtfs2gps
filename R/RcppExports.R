#' @title Snap points to the closest points from another set
#' @description Snap a set of points to the closest reference points.
#' It requires that the distance from the data points to the reference
#' points should be smaller than the spatial resolution and that such distance
#' should be smaller then the distance to the next reference point.
#' @param data A set of points to be snapped (a matrix). The result will have  
#' the same number of rows of this argument. Each row will return the respective
#' snapped point.
#' @param ref A set of reference points (another matrix). The result will be 
#' a subset of this parameter.
#' @param spatial_resolution The spatial resolution of data, which means that from each
#' point of data it is possible to reach at least one point within data with distance 
#' equals or less than spatial_resolution.
#' @return A data.frame with the snapped points.
